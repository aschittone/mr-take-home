Maker's Row Take Home Assignment
-------------------------------------------
Welcome to the Maker's Row take home assignment! 

Before getting started, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't, find an installer [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). You should download the latest version (currently, 9).

About the app:
--------------
This is a simple API that allows creating and retrieving factories. It uses the [Express framework](https://expressjs.com/) and implements the [json-fs-store](https://github.com/alexkwolfe/json-fs-store) library to store data (because setting up a db is overkill). The tests for the app, found in the /spec folder, use the [jasmine testing framework](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine). 

How to run the app
------------------
1) Clone this repo 
2) Run the following commands:
```
    $ npm install
    $ npm start
```
Navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser should yield `OK` 

How to run the tests
--------------------
    $ npm test


Existing Resources
------------------
**/factories**

    GET: Retrieves an array of all of the factory objects
    
    POST: Creates a new factory object
        Expects:
            {
                name: 'Factory Name'
            }

**/factories/{id}**

    GET: Retrieves factory object with the id {id}
    
**/factories/search?q={factoryName}**

    GET: Retrieves first matching factory where the factory's name equals the url parameter q




What you need to do:
--------------------
 - Extend the factories resource to include the following fields `email`, `phone_number`, `city`, and `state`
 - Implement the incomplete `/factories/search` resource. It should return the first matching (by name) factory. Don't worry about duplicates, or about being case sensitive, just return the first factory. *Note: there are currently 2 failing tests because the `/factories/search` resource is incomplete.* 
 - Create a new resource for brands. This resource should have the endpoint `/brands`. The brands resource should have the same fields as the factories resource. 
 - **We want to store both brands and factories in a generic `companies` table.** For this exercise, the `companies` table is represented by the json files in the `/store/companies` directories. A `company_type` property should be used to specify if the company is a brand or factory. Change the factory and brand resources to account for this.
 - Add tests to account for of these changes.
 - Push the altered application to a public repository in your GitHub account, and send a link to that repository to [dev@makersrow.com](mailto:dev@makersrow.com) 

Bonus
-----
 - Implement a delete method on the brand and factory resources. 
 - Improve the app in any way you see fit.
 
What we're looking for

 - Clean, simple, working code.
 - Passing tests.
